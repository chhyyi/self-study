# self-study
Plan to study PyTorch, Deeplearning, C++ and others but PyTorch Tutorials first. I prefer text books&documents to youtube videos but I'm trying to be familiar with video lectures nowadays.  
I'll make some exercises by myself.

## PyTorch & PyTorch Lightning.
(May 2023) I've tried to utillize a deep learning model ([RAVE](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE/)) for a while. But I barely understand this model so I'm going to learn PyTorch and PyTorch lightning.  
* [PyTorch Tutorial - QuickStart](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html) on torch_quickstart directory

## C++
I'm gonna read "C++ Primer Plus" by Stephen prata.
