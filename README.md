# self-study
Plan to study PyTorch, Deeplearning, C++ and others but PyTorch Tutorials first. I prefer text books&documents to youtube videos but I'm trying to be familiar with video lectures nowadays.  
I'll make some exercises by myself.

## Solid State Physics (1978) by Aschroft & Mermin (In Korean)
I am going to study this book as I moved to QMEP lab, department of physics, ChangWon National University, Korea. I chose this book because I have one.

## PyTorch & PyTorch Lightning Basics (Old)
(May 2023) I've tried to utillize a deep learning model ([RAVE](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE/)) for a while. But I barely understand this model so I'm going to learn PyTorch and PyTorch lightning.  
* **Excercises skipped** [PyTorch Tutorial - QuickStart](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html) on torch_quickstart directory. Besides pytorch, I'll review some basics of machine learning or python if I want... but I decided not to spend too long time on it. Instead, skim through other pages on [learn the basics](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html).
* torch vs lightning: As an exercise, convert some deep learning model between raw PyTorch and Pytorch Lightning

## C++ (Old)
I'm gonna read "C++ Primer Plus" by Stephen prata... in someday
